            description2="When entering or participating in a Competition, an Entrant may be eligible for a prize specified in the corresponding promotional material (the “Prize”).

To the extent permitted by law, the Competition Winner will be responsible for any and all taxes incurred in relation to receipt of the Prize."
            description4="Participation in a Competition does not automatically mean that the Entrant has won the Prize. A winning entry (the “Competition Winner”) will be chosen by random draw (performed by a computer process or supervised by an independent third party) or by a panel of individuals adjudicating the entries. Reasonable efforts will made to contact the Competition Winner but if the Competition Winner cannot be contacted or fails to reply to Carviseta’s communication within the communicated timeframe, Carviseta reserves the right to offer the prize to the next eligible Entrant. Carviseta will not be liable if the Prize does not reach the Competition Winner for reasons beyond Carviseta’s reasonable control."
            description5="Without prejudice to the “Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability; Indemnity” section, neither Carviseta nor any Affiliates or Partners involved in a Competition will accept responsibility or liability for any errors, omissions, interruptions, deletion, or unauthorized access to Competition entries, or entries lost or delayed whether or not arising as a result of server functions, virus, bugs, or other causes outside Carviseta’s, an Affiliate’s and/or a Partner’s control.

            description6="Carviseta reserves the right to cancel or amend the Competition and any associated terms and conditions. Any changes will be notified to the Entrants as soon as reasonably practical. If these terms do not, or do not clearly, cater for a solution to any matter which may arise, then Carviseta shall have the sole discretion to decide finally on any such matter. Carviseta’s decisions on any aspect of the Competition is final and binding and no correspondence will be entered into about it."

You acknowledge and agree that you and Carviseta are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and the relevant Affiliate otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void.
